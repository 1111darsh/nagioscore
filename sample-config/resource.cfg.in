#
# RESOURCE.CFG - Sample Resource File for Nagios @VERSION@
#
#
# You can define $USERx$ macros in this file, which can in turn be used
# in command definitions in your host config file(s).  $USERx$ macros are
# useful for storing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords,
# etc.  They are also handy for specifying the path to plugins and
# event handlers - if you decide to move the plugins or event handlers to
# a different directory in the future, you can just update one or two
# $USERx$ macros, instead of modifying a lot of command definitions.
#
# The CGIs will not attempt to read the contents of resource files, so
# you can set restrictive permissions (600 or 660) on them.
#
# Nagios supports up to 256 $USERx$ macros ($USER1$ through $USER256$)
#
# Resource files may also be used to store configuration directives for
# external data sources like MySQL...
# 
# Nagios supports a broader macro sytax past $USERx$. A user can specify a
# macro using $G_[macro]$ and get the same result as $USERx$.

# Sets $USER1$ to be the path to the plugins
$USER1$=@libexecdir@

# Sets $USER2$ to be the path to event handlers
#$USER2$=@libexecdir@/eventhandlers

# Store some usernames and passwords (hidden from the CGIs)
#$USER3$=someuser
#$USER4$=somepassword

# Expanded macro definitions.
#$G_USERNAME$ = secret_user 
#$G_PASSWORD$ = secret_user_secret_password_or_hash
