Upgrading Nagios Core
=====================

nagios-4.3.0 - 2017-xx-xx
-------------------------

If you use "corewindow", as in
	http://localhost/nagios?corewindow=www.somewere.com
note that this functionality has been disabled by default in this
release. If you still want to use it, run ./configure with the
parameter --enable-corewindow

The Nagios core web pages now have a login page and a "Logout" button
in the "General" section of the side menu bar. To enable these new
features, you must update the apache configuration file for Nagios
(nagios.conf) either by running `make install-webconf` or copying the
appropriate sections from `sample-config/nagios.cfg` and include the
session, session_cookie, and session_crypto apache modules.
